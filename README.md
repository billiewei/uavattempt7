# UAV Android Application Qt and C++
Harvard-HKUST UAV Application

This repository contains the code for the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) control Android application created by the Harvard-HKUST team during the summer of 2015. The application was created in the Qt development environment. It involves tracking the flight path and battery percentage of a UAV in the process of delivering objects. The application is built using QML, C++, and MAVLink Micro Air Vehicle Communication Protocol. It runs on both Windows and Mac, and can be deployed to any number of devices ranging from Android to iOS provided that you have access to those builds, though we have only tested on Android devices.

Please follow the steps below if you wish to run, modify, and/or improve upon the project.
